# kilo clone
Attempting to build a customized note taking app based in C based on this project: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html.
The end goal would be to include functionality similar to programs like Cherry Tree (https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/).

Some interesting features might include:
 :: automatically tracking a tree structure that could be compiled into a directory
 :: support for copy/paste of screenshots and code snippets
 :: support for shell prompt with links to github?
 :: LaTeX support or another math focused interpreter
 :: built-in fortran compiler for on-the-fly complex equation support
 :: built-in LaTex-like commands for when a directory or notebook is compiled
    :: ie "c:: Notes that follow the 'c::' tag will be compiled into a 'cellar' page"
    :: ie "f:: Notes that follow the 'f::' tag will be treated as fortran specific code"
 :: support for a built in SQL search type function in which the directory is converted to a database structure
